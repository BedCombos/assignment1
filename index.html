    <section id="Gameplay"><h1>Gameplay</h1><p>Minecraft is a big game. There aare many things. From just building, to getting pvp clients, to doing random stuff to getting a different version, meeting friends. to joining servers, to getting hacked clients(is illegal on servers that are not anarchy servers), to finding minecraft's greatest secrets! You can do anything!(even illegal things)What I do is pvp, redstone and commands, and joining anarchy servers!(I have everything you could think of. Minecraft servers: I am working on 2 main servers. versions: I also have bedrock and java. Java edition is only on pc. I have bedrock on phone and pc! Minecraft can be on nintendo switch(bedrock), phone(bedrock), ps5/ps4/etc(bedrock), and xbox(bedrock). Clients: Pvp clients(2 java, 1 bedrock), and hacked clients(a few on bedrock and 3 on java.)(Only hack on anarchy servers in which everybody has hacks.) Addons: a lot. Other stuff: I have fabric(a mod loader which I have hacked client on.), optifine(increases fps and has a built in zoom. Also for shaders), and forge(don't use it much but forge is another mod loader.)</p></section>
